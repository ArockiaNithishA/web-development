Developed a fully responsive and user-friendly eCommerce website aimed at providing a seamless online shopping experience. The website features key functionalities such as product listing, shopping cart, secure checkout, user authentication, and order tracking.

Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development, and a back-end powered by Node.js and Express (or PHP/Python, depending on your stack). Integrated payment gateways (like Stripe or Razorpay) for smooth and secure transactions. The site is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring high usability across all screen sizes.

Implemented best practices for UI/UX design, including intuitive navigation, search and filter options, and a visually appealing product display. Ensured data protection and transaction security using HTTPS, input validation, and encrypted storage of sensitive user information.
